# Sheena‚Äôs Adventures ‚Äî Game Build Specification  
**Project:** Desert Drop ‚Äî Gem Stack  
**Purpose:** Define the design, structure, and implementation plan for the official Sheena‚Äôs Adventures web game.  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## OVERVIEW
**Game Title:** Desert Drop ‚Äî Gem Stack  
**Location:** `/fun/gem-stack.html`  
**Objective:** Create a lightweight, mobile-first HTML5 game inspired by Columns/Tetris mechanics with a Utah desert gem aesthetic.  
**Playtime:** 2‚Äì5 minutes per session.  
**Platforms:** Web (mobile + desktop).  

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES
**Philosophy:**  
Fast, intuitive, beautiful, and accessible. Designed for casual visitors who may not normally play games but are drawn in by the Sheena‚Äôs Adventures brand.  

**Visual Identity:**  
- Clean desert palette: sandstone, agate, and twilight hues.  
- Minimalist UI integrated with Sheena‚Äôs Adventures aesthetic.  
- Consistent typography and rounded corners to match site style.  
- Realistic gem reflections; subtle sparkle animations on clears.  

---

## GAMEPLAY SUMMARY
**Core Loop:**  
1. A column of three gems falls from the top.  
2. Player can reorder the gems vertically and slide the column left or right.  
3. When three or more same-colored gems align (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they clear.  
4. Gravity cascades remaining gems downward, possibly chaining new clears.  
5. The game speeds up gradually; player loses when the stack reaches the top.  

**Scoring:**  
    Base: 100 points for a 3-match  
    +50 points per additional gem in that match  
    Combo multiplier: √ó1.5, √ó2.0, etc.  

**Difficulty:**  
- Level increases after every 10 clears.  
- Speed and number of gem colors rise progressively.  

**Power-ups:**  
    Shimmer Gem ‚Äî clears all of its color.  
    Canyon Bomb ‚Äî clears a 3√ó3 area.  
    Fossil Blocker ‚Äî solid rock that clears only when adjacent gems explode.

## ACCESSIBILITY

- Keyboard support for desktop (arrows + space).  
- Color-blind mode replaces colors with distinct shapes.  
- High-contrast mode toggle.

## CODE BLOCK GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS
When exporting or updating this GameBuild.md file, always wrap the **entire document** inside **one continuous quadruple-backtick code fence** so it can be copied or re-imported without breaks.  

Use this syntax:  
    \````markdown  
    (entire file content)  
    \````  

Rules:  
1. **Never** include triple-backtick fences inside.  
2. Indent code examples by four spaces.  
3. Start with `\````markdown` and end with `\```` exactly once.  
4. Keep this format for GitHub, Docs, or ChatGPT import stability.
