# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: October 12, 2025**

Welcome to Sheena's Adventures. Your privacy matters, and this policy explains how we handle information when you visit our website at https://sheenasadventures.com.

## The Short Version

We collect minimal information — mainly what you choose to share through our contact and sponsorship forms. We don't sell your data, we don't track you across the internet, and we're committed to keeping things simple and transparent.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

When you reach out through our contact form or sponsorship inquiry form, you voluntarily provide information such as:

- Your name
- Email address
- Message content
- Any additional details you choose to include

This information is sent to us via email using Resend and Cloudflare Workers. We use it solely to respond to your inquiry and maintain a record of our correspondence.

**Website Build Requests**: When you submit a website build request, you provide additional project information including:

- Project type and requirements
- Budget preferences
- Domain information (if applicable)
- Feature requests and project details

This information helps us understand your needs and provide accurate proposals. We store this information to reference during project discussions and development.

**Sponsorship Inquiries**: When you submit a brand sponsorship request, you provide business information including:

- Company name and contact information
- Product or service details
- Promotion preferences and deliverables
- Budget range and timeline
- Social media links and website

This information helps us evaluate partnership fit and create proposals. We use this information solely for sponsorship discussions and do not share it with third parties.

### Automatically Collected Information

Like most websites, we collect basic technical information when you visit:

- Your IP address
- Browser type and version
- Device information
- Pages you visit and time spent on the site
- Referring website (where you came from)

We may use **Google Analytics** to understand how visitors use our site. This helps us improve content and user experience. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect anonymous usage data.

We may also use **Cloudflare Turnstile**, a privacy-friendly tool that helps prevent spam and abuse on our forms. Turnstile operates without tracking you across websites.

### Game Data (Desert Drop — Gem Stack)

When you play Desert Drop, our browser-based gem stacking game:

- **Local Storage Only**: Your high score and game progress are stored locally in your browser using localStorage. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.
- **No Account Required**: You can play without creating an account or providing any personal information.
- **No Tracking**: We do not track your gameplay, scores, or in-game behavior beyond standard website analytics.
- **Audio**: The game includes background music and sound effects that play in your browser. No audio data is recorded or transmitted.

You can clear your game data at any time by clearing your browser's local storage or cache.

### Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use minimal cookies for essential site functionality and analytics. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, though this may affect certain features.

We do not use advertising cookies or track you across other websites.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Respond to your messages and inquiries
- Process sponsorship requests and evaluate brand partnerships
- Provide website building services and project management
- Send invoices and process payments via Stripe
- Communicate about active projects, sponsorships, deliverables, and revisions
- Improve website content and functionality
- Understand visitor interests and site performance
- Prevent spam and abuse
- Maintain basic security
- Fulfill legal and accounting obligations

We never sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

## Third-Party Services

We work with trusted service providers to operate this website:

- **Resend**: Email delivery service for contact form submissions
- **Cloudflare**: Content delivery, security, and Workers infrastructure
- **Google Analytics**: Website traffic and usage analysis (if enabled)
- **Stripe**: Payment processing for website build services (see Payment Information below)

These services may collect and process data according to their own privacy policies. We choose partners that respect user privacy.

### Payment Information

When you pay for website building services, payment processing is handled by **Stripe**, a secure third-party payment processor. We do not directly collect, store, or have access to your full credit card information.

Stripe may collect:
- Billing name and email
- Payment card information
- Billing address
- Transaction details

You can review Stripe's privacy practices at https://stripe.com/privacy.

We receive confirmation of successful payments and basic transaction records (amount, date, invoice details) necessary for accounting and service delivery. When we send invoices via email, these contain secure Stripe payment links that direct you to Stripe's payment platform.

## External Links

Our website may contain links to other sites — photography resources, geology references, Utah tourism pages, and more. We're not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. When you click away from Sheena's Adventures, their policies apply.

## Data Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect your information using industry-standard security measures. However, no internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Payment information is handled exclusively by Stripe using bank-level encryption and security standards. We do not store credit card details on our servers.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Request information about what data we hold about you
- Ask us to delete your information
- Opt out of analytics tracking (via browser settings)
- Stop receiving communications from us at any time

To exercise these rights, email us at the contact address on our website.

## Children's Privacy

Sheena's Adventures is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us so we can delete it.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We'll post the updated version on this page with a new "Last Updated" date.

Significant changes will be noted prominently on the site.

## Future Features

As Sheena's Adventures grows, we may add features like a newsletter signup, online store, or community forums. If we do, we'll update this policy and clearly explain what information these features collect.

For clients of our website building services, completed websites may include their own privacy policies tailored to their specific features and data practices.

This policy is written in plain language because we believe transparency shouldn't require a law degree. Thanks for trusting Sheena's Adventures with your information.
